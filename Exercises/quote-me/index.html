    HELP: I tried to use the BEM method here, but I encounterd some problems:
    
    1.  The BEM method is: block-name_element-name_method-name, 
        but I read that the convention in the web is that 
        underscore(_) seperated words are mostly refered as a single 
        word, and hyphen(-) seperated words are mostly refered as multiple words.
        Why is this? I am strugling to find a good solution, I have to abuse
        the BEM convention or the web convention.
    
        2.  How am I going to replacate those structures??
        
        2.1     Similar to the previous question, but a bit different.
                I want a lot of html files that represent components and not a huge
                file with all the html in it. How can I do it??
                Can I create a custom tag with attributes that will be
                resolved in "compile" time?
    
    3.  I want to keep the structure correct, and for all the links in the document to be anchor(<a>) tags.
        But how can I do it with images? Am I doing it correct inthe profile-tumbnail objects?
        Or should it be a label contained inside an anchor tag?
