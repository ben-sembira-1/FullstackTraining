# My official full-stack training :)
Any code review will be appreciated!

## Goals
Get familiar with a wide range of full-stack concepts.
- Structuring with HTML
- Styling with CSS and its invariants
- Scripting with JS and its invariants
- Testing frontend
- Frameworks, featuring React.

## Learning  Track
I have 2 monthes of 3 days per week, this sums up to 24 work days, So eficiency is important.

In those days I will attempt to read as much as I can from the [sources](#knowledge-sources) and learn (through practice too) as much concepts as I can.

### Knowledge Sources
All the sources are located under the `documents/` folder. It contains:
- The Full Stack Developer (Book)
- 4 roadmaps for: Frontend, Backend, JavaScript and React.
The online road maps:
  - [Frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)
  - [Backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend)
  - [JavaScript](https://roadmap.sh/javascript)
  - [React](https://roadmap.sh/react)
- [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [HTML mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
  - [CSS mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps)
- [mdn guids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [Epic React Articles](https://epicreact.dev/articles)
- [Epic Web Articles](https://www.epicweb.dev/)

### Plan

|Part|Days|Reading Matterials|Excercises|
|-|-|-|-|
|Backround|2 days|Chapters 1 - 5||
|Frontend (HTML & CSS)|3 days|Chapter 6, 9|[mdn Getting started With the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web), [mdn HTML guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML), [mdn CSS guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)|
|JavaScript|5 days|Chapter 8|[mdn JavaScript guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript), [JavaScript Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)|
|Client Side Frameworks|9 days|[Official intro tutorial to react](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), [Epic React Articles](https://epicreact.dev/articles), [mdn tools and testing (without development tools, git and testing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing)|[4geeks exercices](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-tutorial-exercises), [Code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101), After enough tutorials, Move to the react roadmap. This is very react hardcore, maybe the correct thing is just to read about different frameworks and not to learn only react.|
|Backend Frameworks|3 days|Chapters 10, 11, 12, [mdn server-side programming](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side)||
|Finishing|1 day|Chapters 7, 13-15||
