# My official full-stack training :)
Any code review will be appreciated!

In the code there are comments that start with HELP. Those are questions that are aimed to any code reviewer that reviews my code.

## Goals
Get familiar with a wide range of full-stack concepts.
- Structuring with HTML
- Styling with CSS and its invariants
- Scripting with JS and its invariants
- Testing frontend
- Frameworks, featuring React.

## Learning  Track
I have 2 monthes of 3 days per week, this sums up to 24 work days, So eficiency is important.

In those days I will attempt to read as much as I can from the [sources](#knowledge-sources) and learn (through practice too) as much concepts as I can.
