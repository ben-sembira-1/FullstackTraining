# My official full-stack training :)
Any code review will be appreciated!

## Goals
1. Get familiar with a wide range of full-stack concepts.
1. Obtain some experiance by creating one full stack application. See [Financer](https://github.com/ben-sembira-1/Financer)

## Learning  Track
I have 2 monthes of 3 days per week, this sums up to 24 work days, So eficiency is important.

In those days I will attempt to read as much as I can from the book "The Full Stack Developer" and learn JavaScript and React.

Meanwile, I will try to use my new skills to write my own project [Financer](https://github.com/ben-sembira-1/Financer).
